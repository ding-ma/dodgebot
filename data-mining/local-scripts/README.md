# Local Scripts

Some miscellaneous scripts used locally to process data.
* `crunch_number.py`: used to gather numbers from the pipeline
* `local_process_script.py`: used to reset some part of the bucket and metadata. Used a lot at early stage of development.
* `download_data.py`: used to download processed and clean match data from the individual's bucket. It will delete the files after fetching.
