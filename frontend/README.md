# Frontend

* Hosted on Firebase
* Built with React and TypeScript

## To Run

* `npm i`
* `npm start`
* `npm build` only works on the CI server (UNIX machines only)
* `npm local-build` for building locally

## Champion Mapping
* ' has been changed to 27. For Instance, you will see "Kai27saSquare.png" instead of "Kai'saSquare.png"
* All icon name ends in Square.png
* Icon and Mapping contains up to Rell (latest champion).
* Defined `0` as "None" which means no champion since JSON cannot contain a negative key.

Renaming the icons to the champion ID found in the constant folder would be a good starting point.
